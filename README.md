Design and implement a P2P application using a custom protocol built on top of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in the transport layer of the TCP/IP network model.
The application will allow communication between two participants in a local Ethernet network, including text exchange and transfer of arbitrary files between computers 
(nodes). The two nodes will act simultaneously as receiver and sender. This project was made for the university subject Computer and Communication Networks
